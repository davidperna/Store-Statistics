# Store-Statistics
A Program that a company could implement to keep track of their stores' statistics

The program inputs a continuous list of transaction data including the store number, product sold, transaction cost and date from a text file.
Using a 3-dimensional array to organize the data, the program then outputs a balance sheet for each store for each month in a nice readable format.
